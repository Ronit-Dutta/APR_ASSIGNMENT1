Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris Dataset
This repository contains a Python script that performs and visualizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset. The script reduces the data's four dimensions to two for easy visualization, showing how the three flower species form distinct clusters.

Requirements
To run this script, you will need Python and the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

You can install them all with pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Run
Save the Python script as pca_iris.py.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script with the following command:
python pca_iris.py

Expected Output
The script will generate several plots. The primary output is a 2D scatter plot that visualizes the three Iris species, clearly separated into clusters based on their principal components.
You will also get a scree plot, a heatmap of component loadings, and a printout of the explained variance in your console.
